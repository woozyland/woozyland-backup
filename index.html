<h1>Yes, we are the Federal Republic of Woozyland <img src="assets/twitterwoozy.png" width="40"></h1>
<p class="lead">...but what does that really mean? <br> We created Woozyland as a place for everyone. We want to
remind people that they have human rights. We got inspired by the laws of the world and improved them.
In Woozyland, it shouldn't matter who you are. You just need to be nice to the people. Mental harm is a
crime. Woozyland mostly consists of people who had enough from their homeland. And Woozyland isn't
a joke. It might have started as that with our old flag, but now we know that we need this country.</p>

This includes that on the one hand the dignity of the people must be absolutely respected,
but also that laws can be proposed by the citizens. The Federal Republic of Woozyland is a
welfare state, so that all people have the same opportunities. All the actions of the state are determined by this constitution.
